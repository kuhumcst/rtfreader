    // follow a \uN Unicode character to give the codepage code that best 
    // corresponds to the Unicode character. This keyword may be used at any 
    // time, and values are scoped like character properties. That is, a \ucN 
    // keyword applies only to text following the keyword, and within the same
    // (or deeper) nested braces. On exiting the group, the previous \ucN
    // value is restored. The reader must keep a stack of counts seen and use
    // the most recent one to skip the appropriate number of characters when
    // it encounters a \uN keyword. When leaving an RTF group that specified a
    // \ucN value, the reader must revert to the previous value. A default of
    // 1 should be assumed if no \ucN keyword has been seen in the current or
    // outer scopes.
    // A common practice is to emit no ANSI representation for Unicode 
    // characters within a Unicode destination context (that is, inside a \ud
    // destination). Typically, the destination will contain a \uc0 control
    // sequence. There is no need to reset the count on leaving the \ud 
    // destination, because the scoping rules will ensure the previous value 
    // is restored.
